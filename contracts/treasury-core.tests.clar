;; TREASURY CORE FUZZ TESTS - Property-Based and Invariant Tests
;; =============================================================================
;;
;; This file contains fuzz tests for the treasury-core contract using Rendezvous.
;; It includes both property-based tests and invariant tests to ensure contract
;; robustness and security.
;;
;; Note: The 'context' map is automatically provided by Rendezvous for tracking
;; function call counts in invariant tests.
